    "\n",
    "I know many of you will ask an AI for help with this assignment. **That's perfectly fine** - AI is a powerful tool that you should learn to use efficiently. However, you should develop **critical thinking skills** about AI outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some tasks to help you with that, and to see your reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If it is your way of working, **ask your favorite LLM** how to approach this assignment.\n",
    "2. **Paste your initial conversation below** and then work as you would have done normally.\n",
    "3. **At the end of your work**, identify what the AI initially got right, what it missed, and what might have been problematic (if anything) if you had strictly followed this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: The goal is not to avoid AI, but to use it wisely. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not use AI, please mention it while still doing these steps for you to be able to review the initial AI output at the end of your assignment. If you have any comment, also feel free to elaborate on that below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I used ChatGPT as a complementary tool rather than a decision-maker. The core reasoning, modelling choices, and interpretation of results came from my own analysis, but ChatGPT was helpful for accelerating specific tasks such as clarifying certain Python behaviors, validating the intuition behind a methodological choice, or reformulating early ideas more clearly. I mainly relied on it the way one would consult a knowledgeable colleague—by asking targeted, technical questions rather than outsourcing the thinking. For example, at one point I used a prompt such as “Given a 7-day sliding window of learned representations, what are the pros and cons of using a simple linear head versus a tree-based model for 24-hour forecasting?” This type of interaction helped me refine my approach without influencing its direction, ensuring that the conceptual and modelling work remained my own.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first long task was to understand the dataset and the different relationships between the variables (very complex between correlation, autocorrelation, and multiple seasonal dependencies). \n",
    "\n",
    "My work was organized by going back and forth between tests and research, while also leaving time between sessions to take a step back from the problem and try to better understand its depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data, I chose to test a simple initial model, which would give me some initial feedback on my analyses, then I tried to improve it using the results and other ideas about bias that came to me later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I wanted to spend some time looking for a model that would better match the complexity of the problem, namely a multivariate variable to predict (the sum of four variables with distinct temporal behaviors). While researching deep learning, I came across an article that addressed this type of multi-scale problem and also provided an example of implementation. In the end, this was the model that seemed to work best.\n",

    "- We will prioritize the use of **features identified as most important** from the feature importance analysis. This ensures that we focus on the variables that have the highest impact on predicting wastewater volume.\n",
    "- Only few lags are very important (as shown in the feature importance analysis), so to simplify the model and reduce computational complexity, we will be using **fewer lags**. This helps in making the model lighter and faster while retaining its predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhanced Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "- We will have **additional feature engineering** on key meteorological variables such as **rainfall, rain forecast, humidity, and temperature**. (which are shown to be important).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorporation of Autocorrelation Data**:\n",
    "- We will also add **autocorrelation features**, which we did not really used in the previous version, to better capture the temporal dependencies in the data. These features help the model better understand the patterns and trends in the time series data, leading to more accurate predictions\n",

    "Since the data contains both short-term fluctuations and long-term structural patterns, the key objective is to learn a **contextual, multi-scale temporal representation** of the features. This also naturally supports the **multivariate nature** of the problem (ww1 + ww2 + ww3 + ww4), allowing the model to encode how variables interact and evolve together over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this approach particularly appealing is its ability to capture **complex, evolving dynamics** at several temporal resolutions simultaneously. The model is designed to encode both local variations and global trends, providing a richer and more expressive understanding of temporal behavior than traditional architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea comes from this paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10466) — which provides both the theoretical foundations and a ready-to-use implementation. Given its relevance and the availability of the code, testing this model became a compelling choice for our experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the original paper describes not only how to build such representations, but also how to use them for robust forecasting tasks. Across many datasets, the proposed method achieves **state-of-the-art results**, demonstrating strong generalization and predictive power.\n"
